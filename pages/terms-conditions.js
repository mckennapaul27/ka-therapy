<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Cancellations of Sessions and Changing Time and/or Day of Sessions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One week's notice is required to cancel a session or to change the time or day of a session without charge. Without this period of notice, the first cancelled or missed appointment in a course of therapy will incur an administration fee of &pound;20. Any subsequent cancelled or missed appointments after they have been booked will incur the charge of the full session fee of &pound;60. KA-Therapy will send an invoice to the Client at their home address for such fees or will accept payment for this charge at a subsequent session at their discretion.

<li><strong> Session Length</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Each individual therapy session usually lasts 50 minutes unless the therapist has indicated otherwise. This allows a few minutes following the session to arrange a future appointment if required. An assessment session may take place over more than one session in order to sufficiently gather the necessary depth of information required to formulate a suitable treatment plan.</p>
