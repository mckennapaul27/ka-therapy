            <h3>Complaints Policy</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>1.Policy Statement</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              At KA-Therapy, we believe that if a customer wishes to file a
              complaint or express dissatisfaction, it should be easy for them
              to do so. It is KA-Therapy&rsquo;s policy receive complaints and
              consider them as an opportunity to learn, adapt, improve and
              provide better service.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, a quick resolution of complaints, in a way that
              respects and values a person&rsquo;s feedback, can be one of the
              most important factors in recovering the person&rsquo;s confidence
              about a service offered by the company. It can also help prevent
              further escalation of the complaint. A responsive, efficient,
              effective and fair management system can assist an organisation to
              achieve this.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of this policy is to ensure that complaints are
              handled properly and that all customer complaints or comments are
              taken seriously. This organisation expects staff at all levels to
              be committed to fair, effective and efficient complaint handling.

              This policy provides guidance to our staff and individuals who

                <strong> What is a complaint?</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              A complaint is a dissatisfaction about the services offered by
              KA-Therapy or action or lack of action taken regarding services
              provided by KA-Therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              A formal complaint means a complaint that has not successfully
              been resolved through the Complaint Management Process as outlined
              in this policy. The complainant has chosen to formalise the
              complaint by completing a complaint form.
            </p>
            <p>
              An informal complaint means a complaint that has been received by
              KA-Therapy, by telephone, email, or in person which has not been
              submitted on a complaints form.
            </p>
            <p>All non-anonymised complaints necessitate a response.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                KA-Therapy employees who receive a verbal complaint should try
                to resolve the issue immediately if possible. If staff cannot
                resolve the problem immediately, the complaints process should
                be followed. When staff receive an oral complaint they should
                listen sincerely to the concerns raised by the complainant. Any
                contact with the complainant should be polite, courteous and
                sympathetic. At all times, staff must remain calm and
                respectful.

              <li>
                After discussing the problem the staff handling the complaint
                should suggest an action plan to resolve the complaint. If the
                action plan is acceptable the staff member should clarify the
                agreement with the complainant and agree on a way in which the
                results of the complaint will be communicated to the complainant
                (ie. By another meeting or letter).
              </li>
              <li>
                If the proposed action plan is not acceptable to the complainant
                the staff member should ask the complainant to submit the
                complaint in writing to{" "}

            <ul>
              <li>
                When a complaint is received in writing an acknowledgment
                receipt will be sent within 5 working days in order to establish
                a relationship of confidence with the person who filed the
                complaint.
              </li>
              <li>
                If necessary, further clarification should be sought from the
                complainant. If the complaint is not made by the customer but on
                the customer behalf, the customer must be obtained in writing in
                advance from the customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                After receiving the complaint a copy of the complaints
                policy/procedure must be given to the customer, clearly
                explaining the process, the time it can take and realistic
                expectations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Immediately on receipt of a complaint KA-Therapy should launch
                an investigation and within 21 working days should be in a
                position to provide a full explanation to the client either in
                writing or by arranging a meeting with the individuals
                concerned.
              </li>
              <li>
                All relevant information about the complaint should be recorded
                and kept as simple and accurate as possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the complaint raises potential serious concerns legal advice
                should be sought. If legal action is taken at this stage, any
                investigation by KA-Therapy under the complaint procedure should
                ease immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the issues are to complex for the investigation to be
                completed with 21 working days, the complainant should be
                informed of any delays.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a meeting is organised the complainant may be accompanied by
                a friend, relative or representative.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the meeting a detailed explanation of the results of the
                investigation should be given and an apology should be made if
                deemed appropriate. KA-Therapy should ensure the complainant
                knows the matter has been taken seriously and has been
                thoroughly investigated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally, the results of the meeting should be documented and any
                weaknesses in KA-Therapy&rsquo;s procedures should be identified
                and modified.

            <p>
              The manager who receives a complaint will evaluate the information
              to determine whether it falls within the scope of this policy. If
              so, the manager will collect and review all available information
              and attempt to resolve the issue informally through discussion
              with the complainant. Mangers must ensure they maintain
              confidentiality of the matter and respect privacy rights of all
              parties involved.

              <strong>Informal complaint files</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Details of informal complaints should be noted as soon as possible
              and may include information such as when, where and how the
              alleged issue giving rise to the complaint occurred, who was
              involved the names of potential witnesses. These notes may be
              required if a formal complaint is filed. Complaints that are
              resolved amicably to the complainants satisfaction will not be
              followed up. However, all records relating to the resolution of
              informal complaints must be kept within each department in
              accordance with current policies and by-laws.

            <p>Unresolved complaints</p>
            <p>
              If the problem cannot be resolved amicably or if the complainant
              requests a formal investigation into the alleged misconduct, he or
              she must submit the complaint formally in writing.
            </p>
            <p>This policy can be amended at any time.</p>
            <p>
              If you are unhappy with the services that KA-Therapy provides, we
              hope you will discuss any problems or issues with the practitioner
              first. This agreement is governed and construed by English Law and
