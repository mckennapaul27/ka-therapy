                        <p>
                            I found therapy with you to be very useful. I
                            learned many new techniques and found it really
                            helpful that you explained exactly why the
                            techniques are effective and how they work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I came away from each session feeling like I’d
                            achieved something, even if it was a very small
                            thing. I also felt like I was learning new things
                            constantly throughout.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I really needed to be ‘pushed’ out of my comfort
                            zone in order to do some of the tasks during the
                            sessions, but I never felt pressured by you to do
                            anything that I felt would be a bit too much to
                            handle.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I didn’t get to where I wanted to get to, but that’s
                            because I wasn’t ready to move up my hierarchy, and
                            I really appreciate that we didn’t move on to the
                            next steps too soon because I think that would have
                            made things worse.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’m still using techniques learned during the
                            sessions and definitely feel it was worth giving CBT
                            a go.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thank you so much for you time and support - I
                            really appreciate it.
                        </p>

                            Just like too say your session help me so much with
                            my mental health problems. have made some goals to
                            achieve in the future. Thank you for all your
                            support and guidance 10/10 . I will continue to use
                            the tools and methods you taught me and apply it to
                            everyday living.

                        <p>
                            I found doing CBT with Kelly so helpful she had a
                            natural ability to be able to make me feel relaxed
                            and comfortable. I found challenging my thoughts
                            feelings and behaviours so helpful although it was
                            challenging and at times really hard. Kelly always
                            understood and helped by bringing stories of her
                            past experiences with either clients or herself to
                            make it easy to understand. This also made me feel
                            less alone and helped me to understand that others
                            have similar feelings to me. Kelly pushed me to
                            challenge my own thoughts and helped me to work on
                            not avoiding things. I have come away from therapy
                            with tools to help me to cope with life when it
                            feels to much, to be able to face my trauma and
                            accept it. This for me was a massive step forward
                            for me. I really don't think I would have been able
                            to move forward without doing CBT and having the
                            support and help from Kelly.

                        <p>
                            I wanted to reflect on all the weeks that you worked
                            with me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we first met you took time to understand my
                            situation and asked questions to ascertain where I
                            needed support and what support I needed. Your
                            empathy helped build a trusting relationship and
                            created a safe space where I felt comfortable to let
                            myself go and talk freely and honestly about my
                            feelings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You came across as knowledgeable about how to
                            support someone in my situation and provided
                            tools/techniques for me to try. I really appreciated
                            how you understood me and the way I approach life,
                            which came through when you talked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your questioning in our first session identified
                            what we needed to focus on to make the most of the
                            sessions we had together. Each week, you came across
                            as having a clear plan on what we would discuss but
                            also gave sufficient time and flexibility to respond
                            to the progress I'd made during the week and any
                            issues I wanted to go over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I appreciate the personal investment you had in me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The buzz around the return to school has hit me hard
                            but I have confidence in my ability to allow myself
                            to have a down day and bounce back from it by
                            focusing on the positives and the happy memories of
                            our family life.

                        <p>
                            I just wanted to say a massive thanks for all the
                            help you gave me during our sessions. In one of our
                            first calls, we concluded that I had low self esteem
                            and you said ‘we’ll help you improve that’. I
                            remember feeling sceptical because it felt like such
                            an impossible task. But down the line, you showed me
                            that it could not only be improved – and one day I
                            could earnestly look in the mirror and feel both
                            love and self-compassion.
                        </p>
                        <p>That meant everything.</p>

                        <p>Hello again Kelly,</p>
                        <p>
                            Just wanted reiterate my massive thank you for all
                            your time/materials/help which is greatly
                            appreciated. As they say “The proof is in the
                            pudding” in our case I have come out of my shell and
                            began to live again and not just exist as I felt I
                            was doing before crossing paths with your kind and
                            helpful self. The CBT you have delivered has turned
                            my life completely around and allowed me to get two
                            jobs and be consistently positive and confident in
                            all life throws at me.{' '}
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have ceased to be negative and avoid situations in
                            fear of failure and bad outcomes instead I face
                            things head on and ensure I am always happy and
                            comfortable and not just being a people pleaser all
                            the time. I have a voice now and am not afraid to
                            express if I am not happy and have learned to
                            change/modify things to make any experience
                            comfortable for me and never allow others to dictate
                            my life as I did prior to meeting you.{' '}
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            THANK YOU does not seem enough to say for making me
                            the strong person I am today. I will continue to go
                            from strength to strength and never revisit the past
                            negatively ever again. The techniques and mindset
                            lessons/challenging you have taught me will be with
                            me forever and keep me winning.
                        </p>

                            helped me so much I think more positively, I am able

                            visited the hospital to get coffee whilst still
                            waited in the grounds to drink this. I can’t thank
                            you enough for your support. I no longer faint in or
                            around hospitals or watching hospital programmes and
                            I have not experienced a panic attack when
