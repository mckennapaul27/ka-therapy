Our friends, siblings, parents, teachers and social media send us both positive and negative messages about ourselves.

Addictions can start by a substance or activity giving heightened feelings both physically and mentally which leaves the individual having powerful urges to do the activity again or take the substance again.  Addiction  means that by not having, or not engaging with the activity can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Because this can be unpleasant and often painful it becomes easier to carry on having or doing what you crave, and so the cycle is maintained. CBT aims to address the underlying beliefs and negative thought cycles which have led to the addictive behaviour, helping individuals to make connections between their thoughts, feelings and behaviours.  Addictive behaviours can often be viewed as coping strategies, CBT will help to form new more adaptive and helpful behaviours.\"}];e.exports={treatments:l,services:[{title:\"All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet\",src:\"calming-tree.jpg\",desc:\"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
